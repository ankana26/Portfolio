# Portfolio

A website made in HTML consisting of a collection of all my academic details including my education, coursework, skills, experience, projects, achievements, etc. The objective of this project was to learn HTML and create a website to provide insights into my personality and work ethic.
As a part of this project, I worked on my portfolio and added several features such as text links, images, image links, descriptions and learnt to use page layout techniques along with various tags in HTML.
